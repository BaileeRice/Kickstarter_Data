# Kickstarter_Data
## OVERVIEW OF PROJECT:
Louise had reached her fundraising goal in such a short period of time that she wanted me to compile how other Kickstarters preformed relative to their launch date.

## ANALYSIS AND CHALLENGES:
I created a pivot table to relay the information from the Kickstarter data sheet and display(by month) how each fundraiser did. After, I displayed it as a line graph to make it easier on the eyes.

Next, I had calculated how many fundraisers were 'Canceled','Successful', and which ones 'failed' relative to what they where expecting funding wise(simple COUNTIFS / SUM statements. Then in a similar fashion, made it into a nice little line graph.

I had trouble initally wording the COUNTIFS statements for the 'Outcomes Based on Goals' table correctly but other than that, I ran into no issues.

## RESULTS:
I can conclude that there seems to be an influx of fundraisers in late spring, also, more successful ones that come out of it. Could be due to the low amount of holidays so people have more spending money lying around? Also, the theater specific fundraisers seem to succeed more often than fail so I would like to mention that if you put out a promising product, youll likely recieve the funding you're looking for.

## OUTCOMES BASED ON GOALS:
The data seems to suggest that after around the 5k-10k range, it becomes a 50/50 in terms of succeeding, one would assume because it would likely seem like such an outlandish goal to the average contributor.

The chart is very specific so while that is its strength, you also cant rely on it for any other sort of information.

I would've suggested a vertical 'clustered bar' chart to better represent the data next time but it's personal preference.
